Problem: 
In our work (coding emails) we end up mixing and matching a lot of HTML modules, often going into several different files to get the modules we want to include. 

Solve:
We wanted to build a system that would allow us to store the HTML modules, and allow you to insert / mix and math modules to create emails.

Concepts we included: 
OOP // 
MVC paradigm // 
Autoloading // 
Using GitHub // 
Team collaboration // 
Learned how to use vi

Thoughts for the future: 
There are a number of things we want to change to make for a better user interface, such as inputting/uploading files, and the interface styling itself. We also still need to extend the functionality of renaming modules according to how many times they are used within an email, and saving the file out as an HTML file (instead of copying out the HTML when finished). There is also more of a tag system that needs to be built out (or a good framework to be found) in order to implement further functionality. That further functionality is uploading an images folder for a project's generated code, adjusting the image properties / template to work with the new image sizes, and also allowing users to store a project, which is a shell with preset modules. You could then load and edit that set of modules to create a different template.
